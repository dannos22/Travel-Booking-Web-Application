# Travel-Booking-Web-Application

My project, SimpleTravels, is a full-stack web application designed to provide an easy and simple user experience with authentication, database management, and a dynamic frontend.

Frontend: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive UI. 
Backend: Powered by Node.js with Express.js, handling API requests and business logic. 
Database: Uses MySQL for structured data storage and Supabase for real-time updates. 
Authentication: Implements Firebase Auth for secure user login and registration.

I am aiming to create a user-friendly web application.
